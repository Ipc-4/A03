#To use github you have to create an account. Once you create an account you create a repository. Within that repository you already have a branch called main. You can use that branch or you can create a new one. Once you open and alter the file you will commit the file. Depending on what you're doing you can also merge it. 
#To use git you have to download git if you have a windows machine. If you have a mac it's already installed within the mac terminal. Git reponds to the same phrases as github.
#To use webstorm you download it from jetbrains and then you connect your github to it.
